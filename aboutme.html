        <p>
            I have a stuffed animal penguin named Poopoo. The name is actually Korean, where my parents were from. Poopoo is almost 40 years old. This is because my grandmother bought her for my mother when Mom was about 7. I had Poopoo since I was born. So. yeah. This is a fun fact about me!
